# Video-Game-Sales

Over the course of my relatively short life, there have been only a few things that have been a constant and unchanging comfort to me. One of them has always been video games. For those who do not enjoy video games, or understand why someone would like them, I would like to give my own personal thoughts and experience with them.

In my life, games have always been a way to briefly escape the world. For me, different video games effect me in different ways. Some provoke a challenge, a goal to achieve, or just to help the player relax, be creative, and become more open-minded. Regardless, video games have helped me cope, and are a fun hobby to have.

Thus being said, I chose this dataset to see the data science behind my passion. I wanted to see how many people buy the games I play, where they buy them, and which games are popular, or maybe the least popular, etc. The several questions I have, I hope to have answered well and better help others understand the statistics behind video games, along with the deeper world-wide community they have created.
